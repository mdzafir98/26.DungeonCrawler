INSTALLATION for emsdk

**Note only raylib ver 4.5.0 is supported for emsdk

For the very beginning you have to install emscripten SDK. As stated at the site "Emscripten is a complete compiler toolchain to WebAssembly, using LLVM, with a special focus on speed, size, and the Web platform."

Installation steps are prety easy:

    git clone https://github.com/emscripten-core/emsdk.git
    cd emsdk
    git pull
    ./emsdk install latest
    ./emsdk activate latest
    source ./emsdk_env.sh

After this steps you will have emscripten installed into the directory you've cloned it.

Then, you need to compile raylib itself to be usable in Web:

Go to the raylib/src directory and open Makefile, find where EMSDK_PATH variable is being defined and edit it accordingly to your setup. If you downloaded emscripten into /home/user/emsdk directory then put it in there:

EMSDK_PATH ?= /home/user/emsdk

Fix PYTHON_PATH definition as well.

then launch execute make:

make -e PLATFORM=PLATFORM_WEB -B Notice -e option. That option allows to propagate and override environment variables to makefile.

Generated libraylib.a is placed in raylib\src\libraylib.a directory.

After that you can cd into raylib/examples/, fix Makefile as described above and launch make -e PLATFORM=PLATFORM_WEB -B again.

After that you would be able to start python3 -m http.server in that directory, navigate to http://0.0.0.0:8000/ in your browser and see examples.

AFTER installing -> run em++ --version to check

!IMPORTANT steps to do before compiling raylib c/cpp code to webasm!

Steps to run emsdk virtual environment
    1) navigate to emsdk directory
    2) run ./emsdk activate latest
    3) run source ./emsdk_env.sh

Steps to run WEB GAME
    1) bash build.bash
    2) run python3 -m http.server
    3) goto browser
    4) goto http://127.0.0.0:8000/a.html
